# Detection of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images using VGG-19 (Keras)

This project implements a deep learning-based classification model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using the pre-trained VGG-19 architecture.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Transfer learning using **VGG-19** model
- Input: Chest X-ray images
- Output: Binary classification (COVID-19 positive or negative)

## 📁 Dataset

- Publicly available chest X-ray dataset
- You may use datasets from sources such as:
  - [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
  - NIH Chest X-ray Dataset

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available)
2. Open `Detection_of_Covid_Xray_images_with_VGG_19.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell step by step to train and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Results

The model demonstrates the capability of transfer learning using VGG-19 to classify COVID-19 from X-ray images with good accuracy, depending on the dataset quality and preprocessing.
